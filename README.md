This is a scala example for chapter "Basic Type Versioning" of the book [Versioning in an Event Sourced System](https://leanpub.com/esversioning)

Read the full (but short) history commit-by-commit to get a sense of the changes that have to be done to Event Sourced system when
using basic type versioning.

Note that "Double Write (Publish)" is not included as it doesn't work well in Event Sourced systems (see the book for details).
